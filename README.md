# URI Online Judge problems solved


## About this repository

This repo will be have solutions to problems posted in the [URI Online Judge](https://www.urionlinejudge.com.br/).


## Objective

The objective of this repo is show one solution to each problem in the URI to new students can reach a sample to guide the solutions and how to create the code.

This repo don't are a tutorial to use URI and not will have a guide to search, undertand, submit or use the website.

Here you will find only problem description, the same description of the original problem in the URI, a solution to this problem and some more example of input and output values to help the student to test his code.


## Organization

This repo was organized as follow:

In the URI each problem have a category, like beginner, a number, a name and a dificult level. In this repo the solution will use the same category used in URI and the same number, but don't will use the name or the dificult to organize.

The solutions are all included in the path src/main/java/$category/problem$number. Where $categori is the category of the problem, like beginner, and $number is the number of the problem, like 1001.

Example, the first problem, number 1001, of the beginner category is on the path:
> src/main/java/beginner/problem1001

With the Main.java, the path have a README.md to describe the problem and detail the solution.

Bellow was the organization of each category.
