## Description

Read two integer values, in this case, the variables A and B. After this, calculate the sum between them and assign it to the variable **SOMA**. Write the value of this variable.

### Input

The input file contains 2 integer numbers.

### Output

Print the variable **SOMA** with all the capital letters, with a blank space before and after the equal signal followed by the corresponding value to the sum of A and B. Like all the problems, don't forget to print the end of line, otherwise you will receive "Presentation Error"

| Input Samples | Output Samples |
|---------------|---------------|
| 30 | SOMA = 40 |
| 10 | |
| | |
| -30 | SOMA = -20 |
| 10 | |
| | |
| 0 | SOMA = 0 |
| 0 | |

## Solution details

To solve this problem the code use a class `BufferedReader` and `InputStreamReader`.

Two variable, `A` and `B`.

Only one print line using `System.out.println()` to show the sum and the endline.

With this solution you can reach the RUNTIME = 0.048
