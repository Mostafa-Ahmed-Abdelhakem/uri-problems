## Description

Read 2 variables, named **A** and **B** and make the sum of these two variables, assigning its result to the variable **X**. Print **X** as shown below. Print endline after the result otherwise you will get *“Presentation Error”*.

### Input

The input file will contain 2 integer numbers.

### Output

Print the letter **X** (uppercase) with a blank space before and after the equal signal followed by the value of X, according to the following example.

Obs.: don't forget the endline after all.

| Samples Input | Samples Output|
|---------------|---------------|
| 10 | X = 19 |
| 9 | |
| | |
| -10 | X = -6 |
| 4 | |
| | |
| 15 | X = 8 |
| -7 | |

## Solution details

To solve this problem the code use a class 'BufferedReader' and 'InputStreamReader'.

Only one variable, 'x'.

Only one print line using 'System.out.println()' to show the sum and the endline

With this solution you can reach the RUNTIME = 0.036
